![](HR-Strategy616.jpg)
## üéì Capstone Project by Christopher Stanley  
**Learning Center:** Codeant Technology Hub  
**Instructor:** Mr Jodans  
**Tool Used:** Microsoft Power BI  


## üìò Project Overview
The **Employee Performance Analytics** project aims to uncover key workforce insights from a comprehensive HR dataset spanning **2022‚Äì2024**.  
The goal is to understand how factors such as **performance, salary, training, and employee satisfaction** influence overall productivity and retention.  

The project was completed as part of the **Codeant Technology Hub Capstone Program**, focusing on using **Power BI** to build data-driven HR dashboards that support strategic decision-making.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Understanding
- Dataset obtained from Codeant Technology Hub for the Capstone project.  
- Data includes employee demographics, compensation, training hours, performance ratings, and store-level sales.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning (Power Query)
- Removed duplicates and null values.  
- Renamed inconsistent headers and standardized data types.  
- Created new grouped columns for better analysis:  
  - `Attrition_Status` ‚Üí Active / Left  
  - `Age_Band` ‚Üí Early Career, Young Professional, Mid-Career, Senior Professional  
  - `Training_Hours_Band` ‚Üí No Training, Basic, Moderate, Extensive  
  - `Absenteeism_Band` ‚Üí No Absence, Low, Moderate, High  
  - `Salary_Band` ‚Üí Entry, Associate, Manager, Senior, Executive  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling

- Created relationships between:
  - Employee table, Performance table, Store table, and Department table.  
- Built a star schema model with unique identifiers (`Employee_ID`, `Manager_ID`, `Store_ID`).  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (Power BI)
Two dashboard pages were developed to communicate key HR insights:
